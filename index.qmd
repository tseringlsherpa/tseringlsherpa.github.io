I am a second-year PhD student in the economics department at the University of Washington Seattle. My interests are in development economics and applied microeconomics. I completed my undergraduate degree in math and economics at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2023.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, writing, gardening, and spending time with friends, family, and dogs.
