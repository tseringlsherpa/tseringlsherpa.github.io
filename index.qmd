I am a third year PhD student in the University of Washington department of economics specializing in development economics. My research focuses on the Economics of Education in developed and developing countries, with a particular focus on Ghana. I try to understand the choices people make about how much to invest into their own, and their children's education, and when those decisions may be biased. I am also keenly interested in (but haven't had enough spare research time to investigate) how those choices interact with changing environmental factors such as spillover effects from mining.

I obtained my Bachelor's and Masters degrees (both in economics) from the University of Oregon, and before that, I lived in the beautiful Bay Area.

I spend my spare time exploring Seattle and the Salish Sea area by bike, and reading lots of novels.
