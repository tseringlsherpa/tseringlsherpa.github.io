I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Washington. My research focuses on education and gender in Low to Middle Income Countries. I received my BA in Economics, Magna Cum Laude, and Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I also spent most of my life.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, writing, gardening, and spending time with friends, family, and dogs.
