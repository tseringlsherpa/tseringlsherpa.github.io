As an undergraduate at CU Boulder, I was involved in several student organizations, including the American Marketing Association, the Finance Board (as a voting member), and CU Women in Economics. I also worked as a learning assistant and tutor for Calculus II and III. On the Finance Board, I contributed to decisions about student fee allocations, gaining experience in navigating trade-offs and advocating for students during post-COVID budget restructuring. I also volunteered as a reading tutor for elementary students, working one-on-one to support early literacy efforts that had been disrupted by COVID. That experience deepened my interest in education equity and continues to inform how I think about access and learning at different developmental stages.

At the University of Washington, I stay engaged through both departmental and community initiatives. I currently serve as Vice President of the Department of Economics Graduate Student Committee, where I’ve helped advocate for more equitable and transparent funding practices. I’m also an active member of UW’s Women in Economics (WiE), with a focus on increasing undergraduate engagement and encouraging collaboration among board members to organize events and support community outreach. I also mentor first-year Economics PhD students through a department-led initiative that includes quarterly check-ins, co-led with a faculty member, to support student well-being, progress, and professional development.
