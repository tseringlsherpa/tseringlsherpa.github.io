At the University of Washington, I stay engaged through both departmental service and community-building initiatives. I currently serve as Vice President of the Economics Graduate Student Committee, where I’ve advocated for more equitable and transparent funding practices.

I’m also an active member of UW’s Women in Economics (WiE), with a focus on increasing undergraduate engagement and strengthening board collaboration to support events and outreach. In the 2024–25 academic year, I served as a mentor for first-year PhD students through a department-led initiative, co-leading quarterly check-ins with a faculty advisor to support student well-being, academic progress, and professional development.

As an undergraduate at CU Boulder, I was involved in several student organizations, including the American Marketing Association, the Finance Board (where I served as a voting member), and CU Women in Economics. I worked as a learning assistant and tutor for Calculus II and III, and on the Finance Board, I helped evaluate student fee allocations during a period of post-COVID budget restructuring. That experience taught me how to navigate institutional trade-offs and advocate effectively for student needs.

I also volunteered as a reading tutor for elementary students whose early literacy development had been disrupted by COVID. That experience sparked a deeper interest in education equity and continues to shape how I think about access, learning, and support across developmental stages.
