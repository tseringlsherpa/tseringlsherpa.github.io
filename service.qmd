I am an active member of the University of Washington community. I am the current president of the Department of Economics Graduate Student Committee, and have served as a member since 2022. The committee serves as a liaison to the faculty to voice student concerns, and we have worked hard to ensure all students have an equitable funding situation. I have also served as the union steward to the Department of Economics since 2024. I helped organize students within the department to ensure we reached an equitable collective bargaining contract with the university.
