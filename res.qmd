I am drawn to development economics because I care about how inequality persists and how institutional and social structures shape people’s lives, especially in marginalized communities. At the core, I have always been motivated by understanding how people make decisions in constrained environments. Economic models are imperfect, but I value how they combine formal structure with data to uncover patterns and test ideas. This is what drew me to research.

My interests are rooted in the Himalayas, where families face constraints around education, gender roles, and access to opportunities. I wanted to develop the tools to analyze inequality, evaluate interventions, and inform better policy. If asked why, I would say it has become a goal of mine to bring something meaningful to that region, out of reverence for those who came before me and made it possible for me to pursue an academic path.
