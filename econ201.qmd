## Welcome Message for Students

Before we begin, please take the time to read and familiarize yourself with the most recent version of the [syllabus](files/ECON201/ECON201_Syllabus.pdf). This course is **fully in person**, and most of your success will come from staying engaged during lecture, keeping up with the weekly homework, and asking questions early. The syllabus outlines exactly how the class is structured, what is expected of you, and how to prepare for each week.

We will start with a brief review of material from ECON 200 (Introduction to Microeconomics). For many of you, this will feel familiar, but it provides important foundations for the macroeconomic concepts we will use throughout the quarter.

The remainder of the course focuses on **macroeconomics**, which studies the economy as a whole rather than individual decision-makers. While microeconomics examines the behavior of consumers and firms, macroeconomics asks broader questions:

-   What causes economies to grow or fall into recession?

-    Why do inflation and unemployment occur?

-   How do fiscal and monetary policy influence economic outcomes

-   What role do banks, interest rates, and exchange rates play in shaping the economy?

To answer these questions, we will study business cycles, GDP, labor markets, inflation, financial systems, monetary and fiscal policy, and international linkages. Throughout the quarter, we will connect these concepts to real-world events and policy decisions.

Please make sure you can access our Canvas page, where weekly homework and readings will be posted. **Canvas homework is due every Sunday at 11:59pm**, and the lowest homework score is dropped automatically. If you have questions on the material or want clarification on a topic, come to office hours on Tuesdays or email me to schedule an appointment.

You will complete **two in-person writing assignments** during class on Thursdays in the final hour. These are handwritten, prompt-based assessments designed to help you practice applying macroeconomic tools to real economic scenarios (without the need for laptops or outside assistance).

There will also be two exams: a **midterm** and a **final exam**. The midterm covers the first half of the course, and the final exam focuses on the material learned after the midterm. Both exams will be held **in person at our regular class time**.

## **My Approach to Economic Reasoning**

Economic reasoning is not about memorizing definitions or formulas. It is the skill of taking a real-world question, breaking it into its essential components, and using evidence, models, and logic to understand what is happening. This is a way of thinking that anyone can learn with deliberate practice.

• **Economics is a discipline of clarity.** A well-reasoned explanation is more valuable than a complicated one. When you can articulate why something happens using the basic tools of the course, you are thinking like an economist.

• **Mistakes are informative, not failures.** Misinterpreting a graph or misapplying a concept is part of the learning process. These moments reveal where your reasoning can be strengthened, not your limits.

• **Deep understanding comes from revisiting ideas.** Macroeconomic concepts connect to one another: GDP, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and policy decisions are interdependent. Repetition builds intuition.

• **Think in mechanisms, not labels.** Rather than remembering that “AD shifts left,” focus on why households or firms change their decisions, or how interest rates affect investment. Mechanisms allow you to apply your knowledge well beyond textbook examples.

• **Focus on questions, not shortcuts.** Strong economic reasoning comes from consistently asking: What changed? Who is affected? Through what channel? What are the tradeoffs?

• **Learn to communicate in the language of economics.** Many students already think intuitively in terms of incentives and mechanisms; the goal of this course is to help you express that reasoning clearly and confidently.

The purpose of this course is not only to teach macroeconomic tools, but to help you develop a durable way of thinking. If you approach the material with clarity, curiosity, and persistence, you will see steady growth in your analytical skills. Confidence comes from consistent effort, not from knowing everything immediately.

Economics is a skill you build, not something you either “get” or “don’t get.” Approach the material with patience and intention, and allow yourself the space to grow into this way of thinking.

If anything in the syllabus is unclear, or if you have concerns about your progress, please reach out. I am here to support your learning, and early questions make a meaningful difference.

I look forward to learning and working with you this quarter.

**Best,**\
