    "text": "I am a second-year PhD student in the economics department at the University of Washington, with a focus on development economics. I am interested in education, especially how people form beliefs about its value and how those beliefs shape decisions in contexts where resources are limited or trade-offs are challenging. I’m also interested in how environmental and institutional factors interact with these decisions, and how interventions can influence aspirations and outcomes. I am also interested in the intersection of AI and economics through its constantly changing (dis)advantages that it provides humans.\nI completed my undergraduate degree in math and economics in my hometown at the University of Colorado Boulder. During my time there, I did an honors thesis on wildfires and house prices in the United States at the county level.\nOutside of being a graduate student, I spend time reading, writing, fostering dogs, and gardening."

    "text": "I enjoy staying involved with the University of Washington community. I currently serve as vice president of the Department of Economics Graduate Student Committee, where I’ve been a member since 2023. The committee works closely with faculty to communicate student concerns, and we’ve focused in particular on advocating for fair and transparent funding policies. I have also been involved with the University of Washington’s Women in Economics group since 2023, and was previously part of the WiE chapter at CU Boulder during my undergraduate years. WiE aims to connect women in the field of economics (or related fields) to network, raise awareness surrounding the issues women in the field may face, and support undergraduates as they navigate how to use their degree after graduating."

    "text": "I study development economics because I’m interested in how inequality persists and how social and institutional forces shape the lives of people in marginalized communities, including in places like the Himalayas where I have personal ties. I’m especially drawn to questions about education, how people form beliefs about its value, what trade-offs families face, and how those decisions are affected by structural constraints or external interventions like NGO programs.\nLately, I’ve been thinking about how algorithmic systems and large language models shape decision-making and access to opportunity, particularly for underrepresented groups. I’m still exploring how to bring these interests together, but I approach these questions with a mix of skepticism and curiosity, and with the goal of producing work that’s both rigorous and grounded in real-world complexity."
