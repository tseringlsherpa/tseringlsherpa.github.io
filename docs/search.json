    "text": "I’m a second-year PhD student in economics at the University of Washington. I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, and earned my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and economics from the University of Colorado in May 2023. My undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Professor Taylor Jaworski, examined the effect of wildfires on U.S. county-level house prices.\nIn the summer of 2022, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics, where I took a course on Management Analytics in the Age of Big Data, which introduced me to the applications of statistical and causal inference in decision-making under uncertainty.\nMy interest in economics began in high school after watching a documentary in my AP economics class. It revealed the unintended consequences of global consumption, how well-meaning interventions in lower-income countries can end up undermining local economies and harming the environment. That experience pushed me to study economic structures and externalities more seriously, and it’s stayed with me as a central motivation.\nI’ve always wanted to understand the decisions people make and the systems they navigate. While economic models aren’t perfect, I appreciate their ability to combine theory with empirical evidence to analyze real-world problems. That’s what drew me to research: I wanted to develop the skills to study pressing issues using data and to contribute ideas that could reduce harm or inform better policy. Over time, that interest has evolved into a broader commitment to studying inequality, structural constraints, and the effects of interventions, especially in contexts I have personal ties to, such as Sherpa communities.\nAfter completing my PhD, I hope to pursue a research-oriented position where I can continue working on these questions. I’m also deeply interested in mentoring and teaching, especially supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, first-generation students, and students of color, in navigating economics as a field."

    "text": "As an undergraduate at CU Boulder, I was involved in several student organizations, including the American Marketing Association, the Finance Board (as a voting member), and CU Women in Economics. I also worked as a learning assistant and tutor for Calculus II and III. On the Finance Board, I contributed to decisions about student fee allocations, gaining experience in navigating trade-offs and advocating for students during post-COVID budget restructuring. I also volunteered as a reading tutor for elementary students, working one-on-one to support early literacy efforts that had been disrupted by COVID. That experience deepened my interest in education equity and continues to inform how I think about access and learning at different developmental stages.\nAt the University of Washington, I stay engaged through both departmental and community initiatives. I currently serve as Vice President of the Department of Economics Graduate Student Committee, where I’ve helped advocate for more equitable and transparent funding practices. I’m also an active member of UW’s Women in Economics (WiE), with a focus on increasing undergraduate engagement and encouraging collaboration among board members to organize events and support community outreach. I also mentor first-year Economics PhD students through a department-led initiative that includes quarterly check-ins, co-led with a faculty member, to support student well-being, progress, and professional development."

    "text": "I’m drawn to development economics because I care about how inequality persists and how social and institutional structures shape the lives of people in marginalized communities, including in places like the Himalayas, where I have personal ties. I’m especially interested in education and gender disparities, and in how people form beliefs about the value of education when they’re facing real trade-offs and constraints.\nI think a lot about how aspirations are shaped, not just by individual preferences, but by broader environmental and institutional factors. I’m interested in what kinds of interventions, like NGO programs, can meaningfully shift those trajectories. I’ve also been exploring how businesses can adopt more sustainable practices, especially as technological growth brings new environmental externalities. More recently, I’ve been thinking about how AI is changing economic decision-making and how it might reshape who and who doesn’t benefit from these systems."
