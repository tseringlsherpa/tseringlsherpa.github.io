I am interested in how institutions, information, and local environments shape educational and economic trajectories. My work combines causal inference, original data collection, and field-based empirical methods.\nMy research originates in the Himalayan region, where families navigate constraints in schooling, gender norms, access to opportunities, and growing climate risks. These conditions motivate my broader agenda on how interventions and institutions affect human capital investment in marginalized communities. A core goal of my work is to generate empirical evidence that can inform policy and contribute something meaningful to the region that made it possible for me to pursue an academic path."

In the 2024–25 academic year, I served as a mentor for first-year PhD students through a department-led initiative, co-leading quarterly check-ins with a faculty advisor to support student well-being, academic progress, and professional development.\nAs an undergraduate at CU Boulder, I was involved in several student organizations, including the American Marketing Association, the Finance Board (where I served as a voting member), and CU Women in Economics. I worked as a learning assistant and tutor for Calculus II and III, and on the Finance Board, I helped evaluate student fee allocations during a period of post-COVID budget restructuring. That experience taught me how to navigate institutional trade-offs and advocate effectively for student needs.\nI also volunteered as a reading tutor for elementary students whose early literacy development had been disrupted by COVID. That experience sparked a deeper interest in education equity and continues to shape how I think about access, learning, and support across developmental stages."

    "title": "ECON 201: Introduction to Macroeconomics",
    "section": "My Approach to Economic Reasoning",
    "text": "My Approach to Economic Reasoning\nEconomic reasoning is not about memorizing definitions or formulas. It is the skill of taking a real-world question, breaking it into its essential components, and using evidence, models, and logic to understand what is happening. This is a way of thinking that anyone can learn with deliberate practice.\n• Economics is a discipline of clarity. A well-reasoned explanation is more valuable than a complicated one. When you can articulate why something happens using the basic tools of the course, you are thinking like an economist.\n• Mistakes are informative, not failures. Misinterpreting a graph or misapplying a concept is part of the learning process. These moments reveal where your reasoning can be strengthened, not your limits.\n• Deep understanding comes from revisiting ideas. Macroeconomic concepts connect to one another: GDP, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and policy decisions are interdependent. Repetition builds intuition.\n• Think in mechanisms, not labels. Rather than remembering that “AD shifts left,” focus on why households or firms change their decisions, or how interest rates affect investment. Mechanisms allow you to apply your knowledge well beyond textbook examples.\n• Focus on questions, not shortcuts. Strong economic reasoning comes from consistently asking: What changed? Who is affected? Through what channel? What are the tradeoffs?\n• Learn to communicate in the language of economics. Many students already think intuitively in terms of incentives and mechanisms; the goal of this course is to help you express that reasoning clearly and confidently.\nThe purpose of this course is not only to teach macroeconomic tools, but to help you develop a durable way of thinking. If you approach the material with clarity, curiosity, and persistence, you will see steady growth in your analytical skills. Confidence comes from consistent effort, not from knowing everything immediately.\nEconomics is a skill you build, not something you either “get” or “don’t get.” Approach the material with patience and intention, and allow yourself the space to grow into this way of thinking.\nIf anything in the syllabus is unclear, or if you have concerns about your progress, please reach out. I am here to support your learning, and early questions make a meaningful difference.\nI look forward to learning and working with you this quarter.\nBest,\nTsering Sherpa"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m a third-year PhD student in economics at the University of Washington. I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, and earned my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and economics from the University of Colorado in May 2023. My undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Professor Taylor Jaworski, examined the effect of wildfires on U.S. county-level house prices.\nIn the summer of 2022, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics, where I took a course on Management Analytics in the Age of Big Data, which introduced me to the applications of statistical and causal inference in decision-making under uncertainty.\nMy interest in economics began in high school after watching a documentary in my AP economics class. It revealed the unintended consequences of global consumption, how well-meaning interventions in lower-income countries can end up undermining local economies and harming the environment. That experience pushed me to study economic structures and externalities more seriously, and it’s stayed with me as a central motivation.\nI’ve always wanted to understand the decisions people make and the systems they navigate. While economic models aren’t perfect, I appreciate their ability to combine theory with empirical evidence to analyze real-world problems. That’s what drew me to research: I wanted to develop the skills to study pressing issues using data and to contribute ideas that could reduce harm or inform better policy. Over time, that interest has evolved into a broader commitment to studying inequality, structural constraints, and the effects of interventions, especially in contexts I have personal ties to, such as Sherpa communities.\nAfter completing my PhD, I hope to pursue a research-oriented position where I can continue working on these questions. I’m also deeply interested in mentoring and teaching, especially supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, and first-generation students in navigating economics as a field."
