    "text": "I’m a third-year PhD student in economics at the University of Washington. I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, and earned my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and economics from the University of Colorado in May 2023. My undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Professor Taylor Jaworski, examined the effect of wildfires on U.S. county-level house prices.\nIn the summer of 2022, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics, where I took a course on Management Analytics in the Age of Big Data, which introduced me to the applications of statistical and causal inference in decision-making under uncertainty.\nMy interest in economics began in high school after watching a documentary in my AP economics class. It revealed the unintended consequences of global consumption, how well-meaning interventions in lower-income countries can end up undermining local economies and harming the environment. That experience pushed me to study economic structures and externalities more seriously, and it’s stayed with me as a central motivation.\nI’ve always wanted to understand the decisions people make and the systems they navigate. While economic models aren’t perfect, I appreciate their ability to combine theory with empirical evidence to analyze real-world problems. That’s what drew me to research: I wanted to develop the skills to study pressing issues using data and to contribute ideas that could reduce harm or inform better policy. Over time, that interest has evolved into a broader commitment to studying inequality, structural constraints, and the effects of interventions, especially in contexts I have personal ties to, such as Sherpa communities.\nAfter completing my PhD, I hope to pursue a research-oriented position where I can continue working on these questions. I’m also deeply interested in mentoring and teaching, especially supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, and first-generation students in navigating economics as a field."

    "text": "At the University of Washington, I stay engaged through both departmental service and community-building initiatives. I currently serve as Vice President of the Economics Graduate Student Committee, where I’ve advocated for more equitable and transparent funding practices.\nI’m also an active member of UW’s Women in Economics (WiE), with a focus on increasing undergraduate engagement and strengthening board collaboration to support events and outreach. In the 2024–25 academic year, I served as a mentor for first-year PhD students through a department-led initiative, co-leading quarterly check-ins with a faculty advisor to support student well-being, academic progress, and professional development.\nAs an undergraduate at CU Boulder, I was involved in several student organizations, including the American Marketing Association, the Finance Board (where I served as a voting member), and CU Women in Economics. I worked as a learning assistant and tutor for Calculus II and III, and on the Finance Board, I helped evaluate student fee allocations during a period of post-COVID budget restructuring. That experience taught me how to navigate institutional trade-offs and advocate effectively for student needs.\nI also volunteered as a reading tutor for elementary students whose early literacy development had been disrupted by COVID. That experience sparked a deeper interest in education equity and continues to shape how I think about access, learning, and support across developmental stages."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m drawn to development economics because I care about how inequality persists and how institutional and social structures shape people’s lives, especially in marginalized communities. This interest is personal. I have ties to Himalayan regions where many families face constraints around education, gender roles, and access to opportunities. I’m particularly interested in how people form beliefs about the value of education while facing trade-offs that are often invisible in high-level models.\nMy interest in economics began in high school after watching a documentary in my AP economics class. It explored the unintended consequences of global consumption and how well-meaning interventions in low-income countries can backfire, undermining local economies and harming the environment. That experience stayed with me and pushed me to study externalities, incentive systems, and the structural forces behind economic outcomes.\nAs an undergraduate, I completed an honors thesis advised by Professor Taylor Jaworski, where I examined the impact of wildfires on county-level house prices across the U.S. That experience sharpened my empirical skills and deepened my interest in applying economic tools to real-world problems.\nAt the core, I’ve always been motivated by understanding how people make decisions in constrained environments. Economic models are imperfect, but I value how they combine formal structure with data to uncover patterns and test ideas. That’s what drew me to research. I wanted to develop the tools to analyze inequality, evaluate interventions, and contribute to better policy.\nOver time, this motivation has become more focused. I’m especially interested in how aspirations are shaped, not just by individual preferences, but by broader social, institutional, and informational contexts. I’ve been exploring what kinds of interventions, including NGO-led programs, can shift educational and occupational trajectories in communities like those I’m connected to. I’m also thinking about the role of businesses and technological change in shaping environmental outcomes, and more recently, how AI is influencing economic behavior and access to information. I’m interested in who benefits from these systems and what kinds of guardrails or design choices might help ensure they don’t exacerbate existing disparities."
