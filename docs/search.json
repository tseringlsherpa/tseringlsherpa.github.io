    "section": "My Approach to Economic Reasoning",
    "text": "My Approach to Economic Reasoning\nEconomic reasoning is not about memorizing definitions or formulas. It is the skill of taking a real-world question, breaking it into its essential components, and using evidence, models, and logic to understand what is happening. This is a way of thinking that anyone can learn with deliberate practice.\n• Economics is a discipline of clarity. A well-reasoned explanation is more valuable than a complicated one. When you can articulate why something happens using the basic tools of the course, you are thinking like an economist.\n• Mistakes are informative, not failures. Misinterpreting a graph or misapplying a concept is part of the learning process. These moments reveal where your reasoning can be strengthened, not your limits.\n• Deep understanding comes from revisiting ideas. Macroeconomic concepts connect to one another: GDP, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and policy decisions are interdependent. Repetition builds intuition.\n• Think in mechanisms, not labels. Rather than remembering that “AD shifts left,” focus on why households or firms change their decisions, or how interest rates affect investment. Mechanisms allow you to apply your knowledge well beyond textbook examples.\n• Focus on questions, not shortcuts. Strong economic reasoning comes from consistently asking: What changed? Who is affected? Through what channel? What are the tradeoffs?\n• Learn to communicate in the language of economics. Many students already think intuitively in terms of incentives and mechanisms; the goal of this course is to help you express that reasoning clearly and confidently.\nThe goal of ECON 201 is not just to teach macroeconomic tools, but to help you develop a durable way of thinking about the economy. Confidence comes from consistent engagement and the willingness to revisit ideas until they click. Economics is a skill you build through practice, not something you either understand immediately or never will.\nIf anything in the syllabus is unclear or if you have concerns about your progress, please reach out early. I am here to support your learning.\nI look forward to working with you this quarter.\n**Best,\n\nTsering Sherpa**"

    "section": "Historical Background",
    "text": "Historical Background\nOral histories trace Sherpa migration to the late fifteenth century, when ancestors are believed to have moved from Kham in eastern Tibet toward the Himalayan region that is now northeastern Nepal. Religious and political tensions in Tibet likely contributed to this gradual westward movement, though precise routes and causes remain uncertain given the passage of more than five centuries.\nUpon arriving in the Khumbu region, these groups encountered an environment characterized by extreme altitude, harsh climate, and limited arable land. Despite these constraints, they established permanent settlements and developed livelihoods adapted to high-mountain ecology. Oral tradition identifies four original clans, Minyagpa, Thimmi, Sertawa, and Chawa, from which more than twenty sub-clans later emerged. These clan lineages continue to structure Sherpa social organization.\nUntil the mid twentieth century, Khumbu remained relatively autonomous with limited direct involvement from the Nepali state. This changed in the 1960s, when Nepal formally asserted administrative control over the region and designated Sagarmatha National Park. While conservation policies brought global attention and tourism, they also imposed land use restrictions and altered local governance, often marginalizing customary institutions.\nDespite Nepal’s broader struggles with political instability and development challenges, Khumbu remains comparatively safe and environmentally well preserved. Informal norms emphasizing cooperation, conflict resolution, and stewardship of land have played a central role in sustaining this outcome, particularly when contrasted with urban centers such as Kathmandu."

    "text": "Beyul and Institutional Constraints\nKhumbu is widely regarded within Tibetan Buddhism as a Beyul, or sacred hidden valley. Beyul are believed to have been blessed by Padmasambhava as refuges during periods of moral or environmental crisis. Entry is not merely geographic but moral, requiring restraint, cooperation, and respect for both human and non-human life.\nThese beliefs functioned as informal institutional constraints. Activities such as violence, environmental degradation, and conflict were discouraged not through centralized enforcement but through shared norms tied to spiritual consequence. In economic terms, these beliefs reduced the need for formal monitoring and punishment in an environment where such enforcement would have been costly or infeasible."

    "text": "Exogamy as an Institutional Adaptation\nSherpa clans historically practiced exogamy, prohibiting marriage within the same clan. This was not a cultural accident but an institutional adaptation to life in a small, isolated population.\nThe ban on within-clan marriage served several functions. It increased genetic resilience, wove distinct clans into a single social fabric, and reduced conflict over land and resources. By linking households across clans, exogamy strengthened long-run collective action in an extreme environment. This provides a clear example of informal institutions outperforming formal enforcement mechanisms in sustaining cooperation."

    "text": "Tourism, Risk, and Labor Markets\nOver time, exogenous forces transformed Khumbu into a tourism-dependent economy. Sherpa physiological adaptation to high altitude and accumulated climbing expertise created a comparative advantage in mountaineering labor. This, in turn, facilitated the expansion of high-risk guiding work for foreign climbers seeking to summit Mount Everest.\nFrom a standard labor market perspective, the risks borne by Sherpa climbers would predict substantial compensating wage differentials. In practice, Sherpas remain undercompensated relative to the risks they face, and they bear a disproportionate share of injury and mortality. Weak labor protections and fragmented institutional oversight contribute to this outcome.\nWestern popularization of the term “Sherpa” as a generic label for mountain guides or outdoor apparel further obscures the ethnic, institutional, and historical specificity of the community."

Families often choose between local schools with constrained resources or boarding schools in Kathmandu, where children may spend most of the academic year away from their community.\nWhile boarding education can expand economic opportunity, it also raises concerns about cultural and linguistic loss. Many youth educated outside the region receive limited instruction in Sherpa language, history, or religious practice. Some have been documented to distance themselves from Sherpa identity in favor of broader Nepali identification.\nAt the same time, youth within Solukhumbu increasingly express aspirations beyond mountaineering and tourism. English language acquisition is widely perceived as the primary pathway to these opportunities. This tension between economic mobility and cultural preservation lies at the center of household decision-making."

Rather, it is to understand how households navigate constrained choice sets, how informal institutions shape responses to education and technology, and how development interventions interact with identity and long-run welfare.\nThis historical and institutional context motivates my research on education, technology, and household decision-making in Sherpa communities. Through a Sherpa Window has been a useful starting point for framing these questions, particularly as I prepare for future fieldwork and (potential) language study.\nTogether, this context motivates an empirical focus on how households respond to education and technology interventions under binding geographic, institutional, and cultural constraints. In ongoing work, I study how variation in access to schooling inputs and educational technology shapes enrollment, learning outcomes, and aspirations among Sherpa youth, with particular attention to heterogeneous effects across households facing different tradeoffs between economic opportunity and cultural continuity. The aim is to identify mechanisms rather than narratives, and to understand when external interventions complement, rather than undermine, locally sustaining institutions."

I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, and earned my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and economics from the University of Colorado in May 2023. My undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Professor Taylor Jaworski, examined the effect of wildfires on U.S. county-level house prices.\nIn the summer of 2022, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics, where I took a course on Management Analytics in the Age of Big Data, which introduced me to the applications of statistical and causal inference in decision-making under uncertainty.\nMy interest in economics began in high school after watching a documentary in my AP economics class. It revealed the unintended consequences of global consumption, how well-meaning interventions in lower-income countries can end up undermining local economies and harming the environment. That experience pushed me to study economic structures and externalities more seriously, and it’s stayed with me as a central motivation.\nI’ve always wanted to understand the decisions people make and the systems they navigate. While economic models aren’t perfect, I appreciate their ability to combine theory with empirical evidence to analyze real-world problems. That’s what drew me to research: I wanted to develop the skills to study pressing issues using data and to contribute ideas that could reduce harm or inform better policy. Over time, that interest has evolved into a broader commitment to studying inequality, structural constraints, and the effects of interventions, especially in contexts I have personal ties to, such as Sherpa communities.\nAfter completing my PhD, I hope to pursue a research-oriented position where I can continue working on these questions. I’m also deeply interested in mentoring and teaching, especially supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, and first-generation students in navigating economics as a field."
