I study development economics, which I interpret to be the study of economic and social problems in disadvantaged populations whether they be in developing countries or not. I work to design programs that help those struggling populations with their real-world problems, and uncover mechanisms working against their success. I do this in a rigorous way using both randomized control trials and advanced statistical methods using observational data.

I am primarily interested in the Economics of Education, and understanding when and why people hold biased beliefs about education's value and helping to correct those so people make more informed decisions. I am also interested in studying how these decisions are adversely affected by changing environmental factors.
