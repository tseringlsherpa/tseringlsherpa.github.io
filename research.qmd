I’m drawn to development economics because I care about how inequality persists and how social and institutional structures shape the lives of people in marginalized communities, including in places like the Himalayas, where I have personal ties. I’m especially interested in education and gender disparities, and in how people form beliefs about the value of education when they’re facing real trade-offs and constraints.

I think a lot about how aspirations are shaped, not just by individual preferences, but by broader environmental and institutional factors. I’m interested in what kinds of interventions, like NGO programs, can meaningfully shift those trajectories. I’ve also been exploring how businesses can adopt more sustainable practices, especially as technological growth brings new environmental externalities. More recently, I’ve been thinking about how AI is changing economic decision-making and how it might reshape who and who doesn't benefit from these systems.
